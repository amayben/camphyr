Description: 
Our site exists to give prospective writers the opportunity to flex their creative muscles and get
familiar with telling stories, without needing to deal with the legwork of completing every single idea they may
have as they write them.  This site also lets other users add onto stories with their own ideas, continuing a story
that another user has left unfinished.  Every addition “link” in a story posted to Camphyr is known as a “snippet”;
it’s a finite bit of text that serves to develop an unfinished story further. With Camphyr, the stories themselves 
are collections of snippets; every set of snippets is unique to every story.
	
	
Key Features: 	
- Adding new stories: simply type in a title and the text of what you want your first snippet to
- say, and click the “submit” button.  You will be redirected to your story page.
- Searching for stories: Using the search bar on the main index page when logged in, type in a few
words that describe what you’re looking for, then click the “Search” button.
- Adding snippets to existing stories: At the bottom of the story page is a text box; to add your snippet,
write your text in the text box to continue the story further, then click "submit."
- User Profile: When logged in, the index page has a button that allows you to visit your profile. 
- Standalone Stories: Stories you write only posted onto your profile. Click on the “add story” button, 
write a title and your story’s text, and hit “submit”.
