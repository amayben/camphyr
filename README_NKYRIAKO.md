Nicoles edits: 

default.py: 
edit_profile()
user_profile()
download()

tables.py:
user table

db.py: 
auth.settings.extra fields 

edit_profile.html

user_profile.html

Put in the "prof_pics" directory in static/images, dont need the actual images inside 
if there are any in there. 
Also the default_profile.jpeg which doesnt work yet but we will eventually need. 



EDIT: theres also some css I used in web2py.css I believe
