A Unique Approach to Storytelling

UPDATED: 

- default.py
	user_profile()
		-update pretty much everything from here
	edit_profile()
		-not even sure if it did anything but I wrote in the code what you should add

- sample_story_page.html
	- everything in the div id=username (it's commented with my name)

- user_profile.html
	- this is a bit of a mess, it might be hard to add mine and kirby's code
	because I changed the definition of cl in default.py 
	- everything I changed is in the left column div, there isn't actually much different
	but the integrating with the stories might be weird, he is probably adding stories 
	based on email and if its like before with auth.user email you would need to change 
	it to cl.email


I am 95% sure no other files were touched but if there were any, i've had 
db.py and tables.py open so if something is broken maybe give them a look
